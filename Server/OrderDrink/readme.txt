MixerRoboto folder contains php scripts
OrderDrink folder contains android studio files

OrderDrink connects App to server (ip is hardcoded) and runs PHP scripts that run SQL statements on database.

MixerRoboto folder should be placed in server directory.

Currently the amount of drinks that can be listed is limited to four. I will change this in the future. There are a lot of other features that need to be added/changed that I will address after presentation 2.
